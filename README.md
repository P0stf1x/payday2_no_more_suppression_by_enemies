# Payday 2 No more suppression by enemies mod

# What is enemy suppression?

Have you ever noticed your armour starts regenerating not immediately after you got hit? This is most notable when you have a HUD which shows a timer until your armour would regenerate.

This obscure little mechanic jumps in when the enemy shoots you misses you, and prevents your armour from being regenerated for a small amount of time after the missed shot.

# What the mod does?

The mod prevents your armour regeneration timer being reset unless you specifically got hit so that the timer would reset ONLY if you got hit.
